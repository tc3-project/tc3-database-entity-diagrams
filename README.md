# The Caribbean Coffee Company ![](./.common/logo.png?raw=true)
by Joel Mussman<br/>
original project concept by Joel Mussman and Justin Poole 

The Caribbean Coffee Company (TC3) is a cafe-operations project that was developed as the basis for demonstrations
and classwork for almost every software development technology that you can work with, from databases through devices.
All participants can identify with the cafe scenario and have a feel for how it must work.
The core environment is kept simple: products, employees, and customers.

## History

2019-10-07 - Original release.<br>
2020-10-17 - Simplified the database, the original real-world schema was far too complicated for examples.

## Overview

This project contains entity diagrams for the TC3 database.

To level-set, this is a fundamental database implementation with customers, employees, and products
that is intended to be used as a basis for writing server-side and client-side applications.
The tables are basic,
the purpose is to use this database in teaching environments where participants should not be overwhelmed with
field after field of unnecessary data.
The fundamental concepts are all here to work with: multiple related tables, natural vs surrogate primary keys,
foreign key relationships, null vs zero, stored vs calculated data, etc.
It is not a perfect design, on purpose to teach with.

Customers and employees do not have addresses, telephone numbers, or any extra data like that to
keep it simple.
Sales orders have stored totals to contrast stored vs calculated results.
Customer passwords are random and in clear text, recorded credit card numbers for transactions
are in clear text.
Issues like these offer opportunities to introduce and develop security concepts for databases and
application programs. There is a line commented out in the sample data script for each database type that will mask the
credit card numbers if you want to start out with them masked.

Associative tables are an advanced topic in regards to creating classes in object-relational frameworks such as
*Hibernate* and *Microsoft Entity Framework*.
Because of that this database design purposely does not include any associative tables. 
In case you need an associative table for more advanced application work, mapping customers to products
they have bought produces a good example.
The code to create the table and populate may be found in the sample data script for each database type.

## Project Setup

The project folder contains the original Visual Paradigm [https://www.visual-paradigm.com/](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/)
diagram file and exported diagram as PDF.

Of course every project in https://github.com/tc3-project is related in some manner,
but you may want to take a closer look at the individual database projects for H2, SQlite3, etc.

If you want to use them for demonstrations or as the basis of your own labs, feel free.
I consider it to be a compliment and an honor that you want to use my sources, and I would much rather be
